                This privacy notice aims to inform you about how we collect and
                process any information that we collect from you, or that you
                provide to us. It covers information that could identify you
                (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the
                context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect,
                store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information. It tells
                you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are committed to protecting your privacy and the
                confidentiality of your personal information. Our policy is not
                just an exercise in complying with the law, but a continuation

              </p>
              <p>
                Our policy complies with the Data Protection Act 2018 (Act)

                We may aggregate anonymous data such as statistical or
                demographic data for any purpose. Anonymous data is data that
                does not identify you as an individual. Aggregated data may be
                derived from your personal data but is not considered personal
                information in law because it does not reveal your identity.
              </p>

                For example, we may aggregate profile data to assess interest in

                treat the combined data as personal information and it will be
